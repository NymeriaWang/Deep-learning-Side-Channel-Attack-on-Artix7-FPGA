# Deep-learning-Side-Channel-Attack-on-Artix7-FPGA


Software implementations of AES are relatively easy to break by using side-channel analysis because instructions are computed sequentially. In hardware implementations, computations are performed in parallel. Therefore, Deep-learning Side-channel AttackS (DL-SCAs) for hardware implementations is inherently more difficult, especially in advanced technologies.
